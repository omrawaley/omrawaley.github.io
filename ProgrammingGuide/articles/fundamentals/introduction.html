					<br>
					<p>What are computers? What is programming? What can it achieve? This article covers all of this.</p>

					<h3 id="computers">What are Computers?</h3>
					<br>
					<p>Computers are versatile and essential tools that make manual tasks much more easier through means of automation.
						Computers can do a variety of things such as advanced arithmetic, store and retrieve data, and predict certain outcomes.
						Computers are certainly useful tools, but how do they perform these specific tasks?
					</p>

					<h3 id="programming">What is Programming?</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Programming, also referred to as coding, is the process that enables computers to execute these complex tasks.
						Programming is the process of writing a sequence of actions that instruct a computer do do a specific thing.
					</p>

					<h3 id="languages">What are Programming Languages?</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Computers cannot understand human languages such as English or German—nor can they read our mind—so we must communicate with computers using programming languages.
						There are many different types of programming languages and each one serves a different purpose.
						Rust, for example, focuses heavily on memory safety and control, so you will see it being used for things such as operating systems.
						Python, for example, focuses heavily on ease-of-use and task automation, so you will see it being used for things such as data analysis. 
						In the end, programming languages are essential tools that work in tandem with computers to make efficient many laborious tasks.
